### Assignment # 1
Find out the types of modules and list some common modules any new python developer must know.

### Problems to Solve
P1. Using the OS module pickup the dir and sub-dir from a given path.
P2. Add two number and print the output(result)
P3. Declare two number variables and find the remainder.
P4. Use the Input to add two numbers.
P5. Use the Input to find the average.
P6. Create a square root or cube of a number.
P7. Convert the day05/functions.py using lambda expression
P8. Refactor the day06/sort.py by using a loop to take the input from the user. Also announce the grade based on their average score (90% or more A, 85% or more B+, 80% or more B,.....). 
or 
P8. Take 5 input find the percentage and apply a condition if you passed or failed and grade them. (< 50 is fail, < 60 is C, < 70 B, < 80 A, Rest A+ )
P9. Create a 4 function calculator using inheritance
P10. Take an input string from a user and check if a word is part of that input. if then display word found or not found.
P11. from a list of student print all the names starting with "S"
P12. take an input from the user for the same input generate the table ( 2 \* 1 = 2) using while loop
P13. print a list of prime numbers from 1-100
P14. Find the factorial of any number/input.
P15. Create a file and move the content from that file into another file on a different location.
P16. Append an existing file and verify the content in it.
P17. Delete all the file starting with a specific character or ends with a particular extension (txt, doc, etc).
P18. Insert monkey json data from a url into the mongodb.


Extra Challenges: 
C1. Sort files based on their extension type. [to begin with you can use txt, doc, ppt, jpg...] 
C2. Sort files based on their extension type. [to begin with you can use txt, doc, ppt, jpg...] and move them into appropriate folders [month and year] based on their creation date.


### Snake water gun Game
The "Snake Water Gun" game is a classic hand game played by many people. Here are the rules:

Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water, so snake wins.
Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, so water wins.
Gun vs. Snake: The gun kills the snake, so gun wins.
If both players choose the same object, it's a draw. You can play this game with a friend or even against the computer. Want to try it out? ðŸ˜Š

If you're interested in coding your own version of the game, here's a simple Python implementation:
